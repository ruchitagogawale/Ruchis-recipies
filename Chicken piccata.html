                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>I have tried some recipes in the past and found them to be way too tart with too much lemon juice added in, or not enough sauce to drizzle over pasta. This recipe is one Iâ€™ve adjusted over time to make plenty of sauce to mop up with your pasta OR crusty garlic bread!</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and parmesan cheese. Season the chicken with salt and pepper; dredge in the flour mixture; shake off excess and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large pan or skillet heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. When hot, fry 2 pieces of chicken first until golden on each side and cooked through (about 3-4 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
                    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and another tablespoon of olive oil. When hot, fry the remaining chicken until browned on both sides. Transfer to plate.</li>
                    <li>In the same pan, melt one more tablespoon of butter. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan for extra flavour. Cook until wine almost evaporates, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the stock, lemon juice and capers and allow to boil until reduced slightly (about 6 minutes).  Adjust salt and pepper if needed.</li>
					<li>Add remaining butter to the pan, allow to melt, then add chicken back into the pan along with all of the juices from the plate and simmer for 5 minutes to heat through.</li>
					<li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
